Welcome to Sakiko's research website. This is where she will work on R code and blog about her experiences doing an internship in the Richmond Lab.

[Coding 1](coding1.html)
- In this exercise, you will wrangle and visualise data from a study testing whether infants associate people with familiar music. Practice making data long, computing summary stats and plotting column graphs with error bars. Ask questions about variability by plotting raw data too. You can read the original paper by [Mehr et al., (2016) here.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615626691)

[Coding 2](coding2.html)
- Did the Ebola outbreak impact the US election? Do they have enough data in this study to say it did? Practice clean_names, slice, and making scatterplots using geom_point. Learn about the `ggpubr` package to get correlation coefficients on plots and the `naniar` package for visualising missing data. You can read the original paper by [Beall et al.,here.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617718183)

[Coding 3](coding3.html)
- We often overestimate our own knowledge, going as far as claiming knowledge of concepts that don't exist. Is our tendency to "overclaim" related to how much we think we know about a particular topic? Practice getting summary stats and plotting in this exercise. Use geom_jitter and geom_boxplot to look at variability in scores; geom_point will help with scatter plots. Play with displaying tables in different formats using `kableExtra` and `apaTables`. You can read the original paper by [Atir et al.here.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615588195)


[Coding 4](coding4.html)
- Does shared pain increase group bonding among strangers? Or affect how challenging/threatening we find group activities to be? Practice making data long, computing summary stats, and making clustered column graphs. Also use your wrangling skills to verify that the authors calculated their summary scores correctly. You can read the original paper by [Bastian et al. here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614545886)

# MTT project

[Coding 5](coding5.html)
- woot! we are at the point where we can start working with the MTT dataset. In this exercise, you will read in data for the overgeneral coding and specificity scores, make the data long and answer some questions about group differences using your ggplot skills. 

[Coding 6](coding6.html)
- In this exercise, you will read in data for the phenomenological ratings, make the data long and answer some questions about group differences in the experience of remembering/imagining using your ggplot skills

[Coding 7](coding7.html)
- Lets use the Tidy Tuesday Taylor Swift and Beyonce analysis as a template for trying sentiment analysis on the narrative responses participants gave in response to past/future, pos/neu/neg events. 

[Coding 8](coding8.html)
- some stats might be useful for your results section. Lets learn how to run t-tests, ANOVA to test hypotheses re group differences in MTT.
