# How to blog using RMarkdown

You can use this template to write your weekly blog post. Reflect on what you have learned, what you want to learn next, and how you will go about it. 

Create headings in RMarkdown using hash. 

# big heading

## smaller heading

### even smaller heading

You can use asterik to get **bold** and *italics*

You can insert an image from the internet by copying the url and using this notation.

How to publish a new blog post? 

1. Knit the blog Rmd and check that it looks how you want in the viewer. Save and close the Rmd. 
2. Open the index.Rmd file and add a link to your new post 
- to make a link put the text you want to appear in square brackets followed by the link to the html file in round brackets 

This code in RMarkdown...
```
[Week 1 blog post](docs/1_blog_html)

```
... ends up looking like this in the knitted html file

[Week 1 blog post](docs/1_blog_html)

2. Knit the index file, save and close the Rmd.

3. In the console, type wflow_build() and let it chug
- this will reknit the Rmd files that have changed and will generate an html for each one in the docs folder. 

4. In the console, type wflow_status()
- this does a check of which files have been changed and which need to be committed and published (i.e pushed to git)

5. In the console, type wflow_publish(). Put a list of the files that have been changed inside the brackets, along with a "commit" message. 

```
wflow_publish(files = c("analysis/blog_instructions.Rmd", "analysis/coding1.Rmd), "this is the commit message"))

```
