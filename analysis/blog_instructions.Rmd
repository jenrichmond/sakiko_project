# How to blog using RMarkdown

You can use this template to write your weekly blog post. Reflect on what you have learned, what you want to learn next, and how you will go about it. 

Create headings in RMarkdown using hash. 

# big heading

## smaller heading

### even smaller heading

You can use asterik to get **bold** and *italics*

You can insert an image from the internet by copying the url and using this notation.

You can insert an image from your computer, by copying it into the docs/assets folder and using this notation

You can even insert gifs using the same notation.

# How do I publish a new blog post? 

1. Knit the blog Rmd and check that it looks how you want in the viewer. Save and close the Rmd. 

2. Open the index.Rmd file and add a link to your new post 
- to make a link put the text you want to appear in square brackets followed by the link to the html file in round brackets 

This code in RMarkdown...
```
[Week 1 blog post](docs/1_blog_html)

```
... ends up looking like this in the knitted html file

[Week 1 blog post](docs/1_blog_html)

2. Knit the index file, save and close the Rmd.

3. In the console, type `wflow_build()` and let it chug
- this will reknit the Rmd files that have changed and will generate an html for each one in the docs folder. 

4. In the console, type `wflow_status()`
- this does a check of which files have been changed and need to be committed and published (i.e pushed to github)

5. In the console, type `wflow_publish()`. Put a list of the files that have been changed inside the brackets, along with a "commit" message. 

```
wflow_publish(files = c("analysis/blog_instructions.Rmd", "analysis/coding1.Rmd), "this is the commit message"))

<!-- ``` -->
6. In the console, type wflow_git_push()
- it will ask you for your github username and password

Wait a little bit, then go to your github repo. You should see your commit message for the analysis folder. Wait a few more minutes (sometimes 30 min- it's not instant) and your site should reflect the changes.

# How to customise the look of your site

The workflowr site theme is governed by the output settings in the `_site.yml` file in the analysis folder, which looks like this. 


```
output:
  workflowr::wflow_html:
    toc: yes
    toc_float: yes
    theme: cosmo
    highlight: textmate
    
```

The default theme is cosmo. You can change the look and feel of your site by changing cosmo to another Bootstrap theme, [preview them here](https://bootswatch.com/). 

Just replace cosmo with the name of another theme (flatly, lumen, spacelab, journal, darkly and many more), save the _site.yml file and then this command in the console to preview the change.

```
wflow_build("analysis/index.Rmd")

```
