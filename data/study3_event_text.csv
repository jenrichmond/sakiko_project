p_1001,Good,ANX,29,Female,When I was younger I remember that my family friend had a German Shephard as a pet. One day I went over to their house and was playing with the dog and I think I must have provoked it in some way because I remember it tried to bite me. Since then I am cautious around big dogs especially when I don't know the owner because I worry it might happen again.,Some of the happiest memories of my life were with my ex-boyfriend David who I dated for almost 4 years. I remember we used to take photos of our adventures and I'm so glad we did because they really captured the happiest times. Whenever I look at those photos of us I can't help but smile.,I remember being in the sky on a plane to Hawaii while the plane was experiencing turbulence. I got really scared because I was worried that something bad would happen. The turbulence lasted for a while and then things got better and the pilot said it was due to bad weather.,I remember going to a 21st bday party a few years ago and it ended up being a horrible night. I went with my ex-boyfriend David and the party was for my high school friend's 21st. We arrived a bit late and everyone was split into groups chatting and I felt really left out because I hadn't seen these people in a while. Then to make matters worse David drank too much and had to leave. We then got into a massive fight and it was just really terrible and not a good memory at all.,I remember for my birthday this year my parents bought me a foundation (makeup) that I really wanted. I totally wasn't expecting it which made the surprise even better! I remember they left the present wrapped on my desk and when I woke up I saw it there with a lovely card. We then sat down and had morning tea together. It was a lovely start to the day.,On Saturday night I was feeling hungry after dinner so I ate an apple and it definitely helped me feel less hungry and I felt good about eating fruit. It was a pink lady apple and it was sweet and juicy. Yum!,I would like to go horse riding again in the future. I went a few times when I was younger but haven't been as an adult. I would like to go with some friends and make a day out of it. I have seen a lot of movies lately where they go horseriding so it has definitely made me think about it more and made me want to try it again.,As we are almost finishing winter the weather has been really great and it definitely has been the hottest winter I can remember. There hasn't really been any storms or heavy rain like previous years. On the weekend it rained so I didn't put my clothes to dry on the washing line. Tomorrow I will do the washing and hopefully it will not rain.,I can imagine that in the future once I graduate I will be able to earn some more money and will be able to not have to worry about finances so much. I can imagine taking my parents and brother out to dinner at a nice restaurant and being able to order a few things and share them and have a lovely conversation and enjoy the night together.,I can imagine that when I leave home I will need to plant a garden of my own. I don't really have a passion for gardening and do not look forward to having to come home from uni/work and water the plants. I can imagine that my day would be going to uni/work and being busy all day and then I come home that afternoon/evening and water the plants to keep them alive.,When I think of a lemon I think of the bitter/sour taste. I then imagine that when I will need to do a gastroscopy again in the future that day I will need to not consume any food and only drink fluids. Then in the afternoon I will need to consume a sachet of a lemon powder that tastes horrible but I have to drink as part of the process. I am not looking forward to that day.,I can imagine going to Circular Quay catching a ferry to Taronga Zoo and having a whole day of seeing the seal shows and going to see the birds and giraffes. I would then love to take photos of the beautiful view of Sydney harbour and just enjoy the day.
p_1003,Good,ANX,33,Female,"I visited the house I bought and talked about putting a garden there. My husband and I stayed overnight and did renovation of the house. We had to pull the carpet out, the staple that held the carpet together and swept the floors. We went outside and slashed some of the weed trees/plants so we can clear space to plant our garden",The door of our house has a fly screen in front of it and opens with a skeleton key which is really old and cool. We stayed in that house and renovated it. my husband thought it would look good in TARDIS blue. I didn't quite agree. I would rather take the door down and put an old door there.,"my sister got bitten by  a swarm of bees when I was young. there was a tree in the doorway of two houses where each year, for half a year, bees used to come flying in and make a nest. it never really bothered us much until the day my sister got stung. her whole head was swollen like a football for a few days",new years party few years ago I absolutely hated. we had to stay over because we got drunk. I threw up and lost my watch that my sister gave me. I remember wearing an FBI t shirt on the night that didn't belong to me.,"my husband bought me a voucher for nose piercing and haircut last month. I have the nose piercing now. Its nice that he got it for me and everyone else has been saying that it looks nice and suits me. It is silver, made of steel and has a stud","I went to the rocks market when my friend stayed with me last month. it was cloudy and cold. I had to take my friend to all the tourist area and got a little sick of it myself in the end. we walked around the harbour, the rocks, tried chilli, had scone and tea in Tea cozy.",My husband wants to buy a truck to help with taking his produce to the market. He was looking at ford land rover today and thought he might buy that in the future. but he wanted to buy a lot of other V8s as well. don't know which truck we are going to end up buying. we will buy a car early next year,"early next year, we will be getting rainwater tanks so we can keep natural water and not have to use chlorine water on our vegie patches. we might have as many as three tanks to hold the water. one for each shed and the house. The one next to the house will be the biggest.",we are going to put our antique table in the dining room of our new house. the dining room has a wooden stove and window. We are going to renovate the room to put in new shelves and get rid of the old fallen down shelves. we might keep the hot water thing in the wall and have coffee/tea/breakie there in the morning,I will need to renovate the kitchen of our new house. We need to put a new oven. I can imagine we left the oven on and set fire to the house because we left the oven on within the last few months and the fire brigade had to knock the door down. it would be awful If we burned our house down,I will have to sow onion seeds next week for an experiment which will last 8 days. I will be sowing the seeds in the highest concentration of my test substance and it will probably kill the plant. bit sad that I need to kill the plant but it will help me with research for an important project,"I will get 30,000 dollar next year for my phd if I get an apa scholarship. APA is 25,000 dollars and uni will put in a top up of another 5000. this will probably last for the next three years and it will help pay mortgage and other items while we get the gardens going"
p_1005,Incomplete,ANX,25,Male,"It reminds me of a day last year when I visited the Zoo with my flatmate. The gardens were pleasant and it was enjoyable to see the animals. I had a chicken burger for lunch, which was quite lovely, though a bit dry, while Juan (my flatmate) had a vegetarian burger. We ate in a nice garden area.","This reminds me of a day when I was child, before the era of digital cameras. I was staying with my grandparents and my grandfather gave me an old camera as a gift. It was not a particularly noteworthy piece of equipment, but I had never owned one. I loaded the camera with his help that very morning and spent the day using the whole 24 photographs on various silly things. At the end of the day, I found that the film had become jammed and couldn't be wound back into the canister, destroying the film. That was a pity, but I had enjoyed taking the pictures.","When I was eighteen years old, I was out with three friends from school. We were having a perfectly pleasant evening at a party (the birthday party of someone that none of us particularly liked, but that didn't matter), when we began the drive home. The party had been held in  a slightly out-of-the-way spot and it was not a short drive ahead of us. Suddenly, the engine made a series of unpleasant sounds that were followed by a column of smoke rising from the bonnet of the car. We pulled to the side of the road to examine what went wrong; it was beyond us. Our attempts to telephone for assistance were cut short by the lack of reception on our mobile phones. We assumed that we would soon be met by another car, but we were mistaken. We waited for six hours before another car passed.

Perhaps I will go for a walk up to the Dover Heights cliffs on that day; it always looks so dramatic and exciting up there when it's storming. If it starts to rain too much, I should imagine I'll walk back home and enjoy the storm from there instead. I'd probably read then; storms are terribly relaxing. I'd pick something a bit dramatic to read; perhaps a mystery. They do suit stormy weather well.","I will go for a walk through a forest at some point in the near future. The day is wet, but not too wet; one doesn't wish to get muddy. The forest is one of the old woodlands in the south of England; the Ashdown in Sussex by the looks of things. I'll be alone but quite happy to be in the fresh air of the woods. I'll take the train from Waterloo station to East Grinstead and from there take the Bluebell Scenic Railway to the edge of the woods. I'd like to think that I'd just buy some food at a café, but I'll bring sandwiches instead. They'll have beef with cheese and pickles on them. The woods will have a pleasant green smell to them that indicates a forest going from spring into summer.","I will look up to the Tower of London on the day I next arrive there, probably from the Docklands Light Railway as I leave London City Airport; I always fly into London City Airport rather than Heathrow, Gatwick or Luton, probably because I'm usually coming from seeing my family in Denmark; those small flights from the Continent so often fly into City Airport. This day will be similar. I'll take the DLR from the airport and think, as I'm changing to the underground, why do I never look around the East End? I shan't be able to that day, as I'll have luggage with me. I won't mind really; what does the East End really have? I'll be quite happy to be back in the West.","Next time I visit my sister, who lives in Buffalo, New York, there will be a day where we'll go to one of those diners they have in America, as we've been before. And that day, I will forget, as I have before, that when I ask for lemonade, I will not get that lovely carbonated beverage that we in the Commonwealth know so well, but instead a glass of that vile substance that Americans refer to as 'lemonade,' with it's sour and repulsive taste. As always, I will consume without thinking or looking and be disgusted at the results. History is set to repeat itself.","One day I will burn my hand with an oven; it has happened before, it will happen again. I'll be cooking, or rather, attempting to cook something. Something that I'll be completely in over my head about, but enthusiastic, nevertheless. I'll reach in to take hold of the, let's say, baked cheesecake, when the side of the baking tray touches on the naked skin of my hand. No doubt, I'll run to the sink to bathe my hand in cold water, but to no avail. Already, I'll be able to see my skin blistered and burnt in the fateful spot.","I will leave the room I am currently in, when I have finished this programme. I will then go into the next room, where I will be presented with forty dollars. I will be quite jolly, though I shan't count it there; that would be rude. I'll then walk out to the street and take the bus to Bondi Junction, probably the 400. I'll have to stand because it will be uncomfortably busy; it will be just that time of day. I might do a bit of grocery shopping at Eastgate then; I don't like to use the supermarkets at the Westfield, so I should imagine I'll not."

I always have to knock on that screen door and peer through the glass window of the wooden door that stands directly behind the screen one.

Telling me I had been a wonderful parent and he had a fantastic child hood with many fond memories.

That's generally what happened but then my horse suddenly stopped at one and I went flying over his head and landed on my back on the sand. I couldn't breath. I think I was unconscious because I remember opening my eyes and being in pain and seeing my dad directly above me looking down. I struggled to get my breath back. Finally I got back on the horse and we rode home slowly. I was too scared to tell my Dad how much pain I was in in case there was something seriously wrong (I was scared of hospitals at that age). At home he wanted me to ride the horse around the paddock so that I was ok and not scared of riding after the fall. I wasn't scared, but the whole time I rode I was in a lot of pain and finally had to stop and own up to it. I'd broken a rib.","I am in the offie and I have a lot of documents to shred.

I am then the expression of the physics these pressures had herein contained. In a future event, I see the storm dynamic converging. And in watching it, but not just because I am ""watching"" it, I am not essentially apart of it. I am within it, but it is outside of me. I can experience it without it finding the centre of me. I see a future event that can be both gloomy or bright. The dynamics of the light bears no foothold in the beginnings of the result. But it does end in light, regardless of the context. A light in being apart, and not predetermined by it all. It's a freedom only delivered in the moment that it's enjoyed, but an essence then in absence, ineffable and undefined. Until it another time converges the silent shaping of a being not fully held in moments except the moment of itself, now clearly and distinct, defined.","I think of holidays when I think of water.

It finds me easily, but each time is unique. I think it will ask me of all the outstretching moments that are aligned by their future events.

There are even a couple of shadows in the background in the form of people that I think are those already passed away that returned for the photo!","I wish I did not have this memory but I was recently attending my mother's 90th birthday party and had volunteered to give a speech, it was the welcome speech once everyone had arrived and sat down, all family, extended family, people had travelled from various states. In my not-so-well prepared speech, amongst other things I said, I remembered a few people who have left us in the form of my mother's siblings, 3 of them, and remembered my mother's sister who could not attend due to not being well enough to travel, I then remembered the fathers/husbands who had all passed away but completely forgot one! He was the nicest man, my uncle, but had died so many years ago, it was no excuse, he has never been forgotten. I finished the speech, sat down at a table and remembered with horror. I then apologised quietly to 3 of my cousins that I had forgotten their father. They were gracious. I felt terrible. I can't seem to forget that speech.","I consider myself an indoor person as I love books, tv film and don't seem to have an appreciation of the great outdoors that so many people do. Therefore I absolutely hate it when insects come in the house, I get bothered by one fly and will spend too much time just to get it out of the house. Every now and then a bird will enter the house through an open window. I've been known to scream to get one of my children to assist me to get it out! I actually get scared. Not just insects and birds, I worry if I see a dog on the street as I imagine it will bite my leg, always, I can see the injury. As a result dogs seem to bark at me, I am told that I give off a scent of fear that sets dogs off. I have had dogs growling at me and their owners have commented that they are not usually like that. I know it is my fault. I've even apologised and told dog owners it is my own fault. One day my son as a joke put a cat on the back of my neck as we walked up the driveway of some neighbours. I cried. I so easily could have had a heart attack and died just from that.","I am currently learning the piano and finding it one of the best things I have done such is the level of enjoyment I am gaining from it. I tinkered as a child and seem to have forgotten everything, I then took it up again a few years ago but had a negative experience with a teacher or two. I have found a teacher who I can really relate to and am managing to bat off some feelings of negativity to be slowly and surely learning some nice classic pieces. This is a long journey but I am in no hurry and find that when I sit down at home to practise I feel elated, especially after I master something that initially I thought too difficult.","I usually try to eat an apple a day. I have one in my bag and bring out when I am driving. It seems to be when I mainly eat an apple. But I always eat apples whilst waiting to see my doctor. The other day I visited this doctor and told him I had been thinking about him and needing his advice and asked him if he got my psychic messages? I was half joking but half serious. He is a naturopath and I wanted his advice but did not have time to see him at an appointment. He said ""yes I did think of you Helen, brought on by a bag of apples""","I had not been living in Sydney long, it was about 25 years ago, nearly 30 actually, and I could not believe the summer downpours of rain that occurred, suddenly, heavily and were over quickly. the weather has changed a bit and this no longer happens but I do have a nice memory of my family visiting from Victoria, for my wedding, and we were at a hotel over the road from Bondi beach and a storm occurred, the heaviest rain ever, we were inside and watched the spectacle. It was nice and fun, and a happy  occasion to recall.","I love swimming, over my life I have been in and out of swimming as a lovely form of exercise and relaxation. At the moment I am swimming only once a week but I want to aim to swim more, about every second day. I want to build up and have a swimmers body, better arms and better muscles, more firm and taut then I currently am. I will be in an indoor pool and aim to be at the pool in non-peak hour as the best way for me to enjoy swimming laps is to not be too bothered by other people.","Christmas lunch, which I am hosting, will be served on a long dining table, carefully decorated with a theme we ran with 2 years ago, an aboriginal table-cloth that set the theme of the day. I liked this so much that I will do it all again, even if the same people are attending, I do not feel the need to purchase new decoration for the day. We will have bon-bons and candles and a bit of glitter but I like the idea of the long table set up for a good long lunch and a happy day.","A letter as a form of communication is not common these days but I am imagining a letter of bad news about not getting a job that I had so confidently applied for. I think to receive this would be a blow to my confidence, I would feel a bit upset if it seemed to be a position I had my heart set on, but I think I might have to tell myself that it was not meant to be rather than be further upset. I would next be wondering what I could have done better in the application or interview, and wonder also about the winning applicant.","It is Christmas Day and I am tasked with cooking the turkeys as I am hosting lunch at home this year. I am hoping this negative event certainly does not happen but if the oven does not work I will not be able to cook the turkeys, throwing the day into a bit of chaos. I am imagining that my stress headache will be a  bit worse than ever, and that I will be upset but have to hide the upset, try to be calm, think about an oven I could use as a back-up, annoying because I will not be in my own kitchen.",I am imagining being at the Opera House and getting the best view of one of those cruise ships that sometimes comes into Sydney Harbour. eg QE2. They are unbelieveable in size and great to view from the shoreline and I imagine anyone cruising into Sydney on one of these ships would enjoy the sight of Circular Quay at night and the people waving. It can be a real buzz to be down there on a good evening. A lot to see and do.

There were tons of flowers all very colorful and varietals that are very unique.  There is a large pond with lotus flowers and a path neandering around garden.  My aunt would take a lot of photos of these flowers on her iphone. We stopped at a cafe in the garden called ""Coffee Cat"".","I went to go see Fifity Shades of Grey a movie based on  a book by EL James.  I got a free ticket to Hoyts Cinema and decided to go on my own since my partner refused to go with me due to the bad reviews.  I went up to the candy counter got my ticket and went up to the Cinema which was Cinema 8.  I was the first one in the theater and sat in row H at the center of row.  Finally, some more movie goers arrived around 15-10 min before the show was about to start.","I was at my PhD Graduation where I was semi hung over from my party that I had the night before.  originally, we wanted to have the party on my graduation day or the day after but because my graduation was in Dec the restaurant where wanted to go was completely booked out except for the night before my graduation. I drank a lot of wine and felt very tired when getting dressed and getting ready to go into the Quad where the graduation ceremony was held.  I hated my PhD and felt like this occasion was glorifying one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life.  I went put on a big smile for my relatives because they flew overseas to see this special occasion where for me it was one big joke.",I remembered coming back from Southern Highlands wine country on a one day trip and felt really sick and dizzy on the car ride back. I kept thinking to myself why do I feel this way? I hardly drank and it wasn't as if the car was undergoing a bad jerky stop/start motion as it would normally do in the City.  I remember looking outside and looking as far away into the horizon to stop myself from vomiting. My partner was going to drop me off at my flat in Kirribilli and I couldn't wait to get to the bathroom as I knew I was going to be sick.,"I went back to visit the faculty members in the Science Dept at Manhattan College in Riverdale Bronx (my alma mater).  I love going back to visit every time when I go back to NY because it reminds me of the happy times of Undergraduate Study.  I usually go see the secretaries first at the Dean's Office and we would chat about how my life is going in Australia. During this day, I went upstairs and went to go see my former Physical Chemistry instructor and we chatted for an hour about life in general and about how teaching is going with the department. I can see his office is still messy as always and tons of chemistry books scattered everywhere.",My partner made a dish for dinner last night which contained apples.  It was a roast pork with an apple cider jus and he also pan fried some apples to accompany the dish.  I remember feeling starved and could smell carraway and fennel roasted pork in the living room. We had a nice glass of French gamay with the meal - the tartness of the wine really cut through the fattyness of the pork.  He accompanied the dish with bacon and brussel sprouts on the side.,"Going to Coogee beach and relaxing in the sun. Will apply a lot of sun screen and try to avoid direct sun exposure.  Usually, my partner will drive to the beach where we will stay on the beach for 1/2 day (usually packing a lunch). Will bring lots of water and cold beverages as it's been very hot.",I am in a house in NY where there is a heavy snow storm that will bring about 12 inches of snow. the front of my house is covered in white powder and the drive way is packed with ice.  The plow man has to come and remove all of the snow and pile it to the top of the drive way before anyone can attempt to drive up the drive way.  The street in front of my house is white where no one has attempted to drive on the slick road.,I love to bake and would sometimes bake things that I've never baked before or have struggled to bake in the past. One of the things that I've made is a cheesecake and I haven't made one yet that I felt looked and tasted fantastic.  I can see myself going through 4 hours of intensive labor for a cheesecake only to have it not come out as I would like and having to eat it anyway because the ingredients were so expensive.  Part of it is that there is a secret to not cracking the top of the cake and that is to slowly cook and cool it down in the oven.,"When me and my partner buy oysters we like to go lemon wedges for an accompaniment.  Usually at the fish market, they supply you with one lemon wedge and if you wanted more it's an extra 20 cents (or more).  It would be a terrible if we were to have bought the whole dozen oysters just to go home and find that they had forgotten to add an extra lemon wedge that we ordered. Between being ripped off and having to go back to the store, it would spoil our evening.",Me and partner go on a picnic in Balmain after going to the fish market to go buy some fresh oysters and sashimi.  We dislike sitting at the Fish Market because the birds come around and try to take food from visitors.  We end up near Ballast Point in Balmain (after driving from the Fish Market) and set up a picnic blanket overlooking the Harbour and we can see the Harbour Bridge from afar.  The ferries come into the wharf (Balmain wharf) from time to time to pick up and drop off passengers.,Me and my partner are invited to a wedding that will be in wine country in October. I imagine that the table will be filled with his friends who I have met before and get on with very well. It will be a degustation menu and they will have several wines on offer.  I assume that the place setting will be elegant - flowers on table with guests names placed near the chairs of where they should be seated.

I remember my unpleasant face while taking it since I was upset and didn't like taking pictures in the first place.","I went back to Myanmar 2 years ago. After landing there quite nervously since I haven't seen my cousins for a long time, me and my family rode a car home with my cousins and uncle asking me a lot of questions about Hong Kong. When we got home, there are neighborhood dogs in the yard and I am scared of them since they bark at strangers although I am a dog lover. However, when I exited from the car, the brown dog that was very close by did not bark at me at all and seemed to remember me.","My typical day when I was in elementary school was that in after the classes finish, my class head off home together. However, I always take the shortcut with my friends to get to the car park at the lower campus faster without the teachers noticing. The driver would be waiting for me with a yogurt drink. I would drink it and sit at the back of the car, on the side that would be closest to the house when we reach home.

I was very happy and could not stop thanking her until she went back home. It was the best present I got from a friend.","I went to the music theory grade 1-5 exam with my mom as I was learning grade 4 piano.

As I drive around the city, I'm supposed to be focused on the road but all I can think about are these two people.","I had flown on airplanes many times before this day without any issue. However, for some reason, nothing seemed to be going right today. As I walked onto the plane, the smell of the plane itself started to make me feel uneasy. As the plane rumbled to start moving off on the runway, my stomach lurched. Every little movement of the plane in the air seemed to be affecting me. I found this strange because I had never suffered from motion sickness before. It was a long flight and although I usually enjoy this as time I can relax and read, all I could think about was when I was going to throw up.","It''s a Sunday morning in early December. I'm at home and doing homework from the week before. Just then my parents come in and tell me that they've decided that I can open my presents early. Because my birthday is close to Christmas, that means two presents. However, it also means two presents that I have to wait all December to open. The presents often sit below the Christmas tree and I look a them longingly whenever I walk past. I'm elated to hear what my parents have to say. I rush through the house to get to the Christmas tree.","I'm extremely nervous for a piano recital I'm about to have. This is the first time I've ever performed for an audience that wasn't my family or my teacher. When my name is called, I walk up to the piano. At first, my hands are on the keys but I'm taking a while to start. I'm so nervous that my palms are sweaty and I'm afraid I'll slip. I take a deep breath and start playing. As I play on, it starts to get easier and it feels like just any other time I've played at home. As the song ends, I take up a take a small bow. I'm getting applauded. I think this is the first time I've ever gotten applauded.","I'm standing at the tap behind my house. It's a very hot day, one of the hottest in summer. I'm standing there because just moments before I had been sitting on the couch in the house and thinking of a way to beat the heat. My housemate has the idea of filling up large basins with water and dousing ourselves with it. I'm excited and we're here.","I'm camping with a couple of friends. We have been hiking the whole day and we've finally settled down for the night to get some rest. I'm tired but glad that I'm getting a chance to spend some quality time with this group of friends. We're sitting around in the tent talking, thankful for having this opportunity. Suddenly, a storm breaks out and the rain comes pelting down hard on the tent. We can barely hear each other talk over the sound of raindrops hitting the tent. We decide to get some rest. As I lay there trying to fall asleep, I'm really hoping that the tent doesn't flood.","My in-laws are coming over for dinner. I had mentioned many times to them that I enjoyed cooking and my father-in-law has challenged me to bake a pie. I very much want to impress him but this is the first time I have ever made a pie and it is not going well. I'm pacing up and down in front of the oven, fingers crossed that this is going to go well. As the timer goes off, I open the oven and peer in. It seems fine at first but as I cut into the pie I'm devastated. I hadn't cooked the filling well before placing it in the pastry so it's still under cooked even though the pastry is done. They'll be here in 10 minutes and it's going to be too difficult to fix this. I'm racked with stress.",I sit down at the dining table to open letters in the mail after a long day in school. I'm tired and hadn't performed well in class so I'm already not in a very good mood. Just then I noticed one of the letters was from the organisation to which I had applied for a scholarship. I'm nervous and desperately trying to recall details about the interview that I had a few months ago. I open and read the letter. I've been rejected. I'm devastated.,"I'm on a cruise on vacation with my family. It's hard enough already trying to find time for a vacation with my family but this is also my first time taking a cruise. I'm excited. As I'm walking around the deck, I spot a friend who I have not seen in ages. At first, I'm hesitant to go over and say hi. What if they don't remember me. I work up the courage to introduce myself. He is at first a bit puzzled as to who I am but as he slowly realizes, a grin breaks out across his face.",I'm nervous because I'm about to go on a blind date with someone. I have never done one of these before but a friend of mine convinced me to give it a shot. We've decided to meet and go up the Sydney tower. I pick her up at her place. She seems nice and conversations flows much better than I had anticipated. I usually have difficulty meeting new people but I seem to get along with this person. We have a nice time and make plans to meet up again.

My daughter gone missing in the chaos and I'm desperate to find her, but I can't.

p_4006,Good,CON,24,Male,"I bought a book the other day as a present to say thank you to a colleague. It was book I had read before, and when so doing, could think of no one but her. It's funny how certain stories can take hold of you and remind you of someone or something from your own life. I should have bought the book when I first though to. As it turned out, I hastily bought it on my way to meet with my colleague. This lack of planning meant I had to run around the city trying to find a bookstore that stocked it. I used the internet to help me locate a store - I was successful in this. My colleague liked the gift and emailed me that same night to say thank you.","I've never been much of a 'green-thumb' or gardening enthusiast. However, the house I currently live in with my parents has a large garden which demands attention. I can remember a particular Saturday last summer where I had to mow all four of the lawns on or around our property. We live in the city, but this is still a large undertaking. As I pushed and pulled the lawnmower and cut the grass, I can remember the smell of freshly cut grass, the feel of hot, wet grass on my shins as I emptied the clippings into our green-waste bin. I hated this experience, as I've hated all Saturdays which have been taken up with mowing. I know one thing, though, when I move out, I sure won't be buying a property with many lawns - a concrete jungle will suit me just fine.","I remember when I was in kindergarten, we were asked to write letters to Santa around Christmas time. I was under the impression that we'd be receiving the presents from the school, so I modestly wrote down that I wanted ""paper and pens"" as I though this would be feasible and wouldn't be seen as ""asking for much."" In the end, we were never getting the presents from the school - I had misunderstood the activity. As we went around the class and revealed what it was we wanted to receive from Santa, my request for stationary looked trivial compared to other students' desires for water pistols, Barbies, clothes and other such things. I felt embarrassed: I wanted to re-do the situation and pick something else!","I'm struggling to think of a negative memory about the word sky - I guess the only thing I can thing about is my first long-haul flight overseas. Taking off and ascending into the sky made me feel so, so nervous and really played on my insecurities of flying. My palms were sweating, I was gripping the seat, I was getting annoyed at the sound of others speaking in the plane. I overcame this by remembering that flight attendants fly everyday as part of their jobs and they wouldn't put themselves in such great danger if flying was as dangerous as my insecurities were telling me they were.","I remember just after I graduated from High School I used to go out with my friends a lot, drinking and having a fun time. One particular time, many years ago now, I met up with my then-best mate and two other friends and the four of us had a wild party in one their house: drinks were flowing and so were the tunes. That night someone played a song called ""I love college"" and it was all about living a typical American college life at university. When I think back on it now, it was such a fun night and that song seems to be such a focal point of the night for me.",I had a meeting with my old Honours supervisor yesterday about my upcoming appointment as a tutor for her second year class. When I arrived she informed me that she had spilled coffee all over her Apple laptop and needed to rush off after our meeting for an appointment with the Apple Store to get it fixed. I guess the reason this situation stuck with me was because she emailed me later than night to say thank you for the books I had gifted her and informed me about how her meeting with the Apple Store went. It was nice finally feeling like we were colleagues and talking like adult professionals.,"Tomorrow I plan to take a walk through a forest near my house. It's one of those popular walking trails so I'm sure i'll see a lot of people along the way. It's lovely getting out into nature: seeing all the flora and fauna and smelling nature at its best. If I enjoy it, perhaps i'll make it a regular thing!","Summer always brings about horrific storms, usually preceded by intense heat and humidity. I look forward to the next big storm and want to sit out on my veranda for an hour or two watching it pass me by. Sitting in intense darkness, I anticipate the crashing of thunder from up above and then the incandescence of the night sky lit up as lightening makes its way to the earth. As I sit through this natural phenomena, this event penetrates through my skin and ears, engendering goosebumps to appear on my skin.","I recently applied to Harvard university to undertake a PhD in anthropology. the application process was very challenging and it took a lot of time and effort. I haven't heard anything back from Harvard yet, but expect to get a letter in the mail letting me know I've been unsuccessful. Despite this, I'm still proud of myself for applying!","I can see myself in the future burning a meal in an oven. It will probably be a cake of some description and I'll really hope it turns out nicely. It probably won't, however, as I'm not the best cook - this will disappoint me. I am, however, good at preparing other sorts of deserts but I'd like to expand my repertoire.","I've been lucky enough to be invite this year to tutor a class for my old Honours supervisor. Even though I feel really inexperienced, I can already see myself taking the class' attendance and marking their assessments. I can see myself filling in a table with their marks and attendance records and it excites me.","I'd like to do more travelling in the future and climb many tall buildings and towers in foreign cities. I can imagine myself climbing a really beautiful tower in some Italian city. It'll probably take an hour or so to climb all the stairs and reach the top, but once there, I can imagine a beautiful view of the city beneath me, I can imagine myself smiling and not wanting to get down."

My parents love to see greens and plants. We went into an enclosure where heaps of plants and flowers were in there. The temperature was cool and the environment was lovely.

These things hold memories of being happy to being sad. Well, leaving the comfort of home and having to fly here to study in a prestigious University makes me sad at the airport and on the plane. The memories of seeing my family, relatives and friends for the last time at the airport will always be in my mind.","One time while I was 9 years old, we had a fun time bowling with my family and relatives. We had food and drinks, and I remember, vividly, drinking milo. A few hours later, my tummy was oozy. We were about to go home, so I thought I can hold it through the journey back in the car. Unfortunately, you guess it. Until a point near my house, my stomach couldn't take it, and I puke all over in the car. Gosh, I feel so guilty for both of my parents. They had to clean the car up themselves, moreover, it was close to mid-night. I remember them bringing the pills, towels and air fresher down. I was told to clean myself up, and go to bed.","College was probably my second most enjoyable of education life. Friends and teachers were awesome.
